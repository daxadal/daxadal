# Hi, welcome!

My name is Eric Garc√≠a de Ceca Elejoste.
I'm a Senior Fullstack Developer experienced in Javascript / Typescript, specially with NodeJS, React and Vue.js.

# My JS / TS projects

# Other projects

I've always been curious about the video game industry, so a couple of times I tried to learn by myself:

- [Puffy Ball](https://github.com/daxadal/Puffy-Ball): During a couple of months I was learning Unity by myself. Beside some test projects, I implemented this little Flappy Bird replica. It's also uploaded as a [playable version](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/release-webgl-2).
- [Element Crash](https://github.com/daxadal/element-crash): During my university years I programmed in Java, and I tried to apply my knowledge by making a Candy Crush version using Libgdx to implement graphics. I came up with a basic functional prototype with a single-player mode and a couple of two-player modes.

# And what outside programming?

Not everything is programming, and it's good for you to have hobbies aside from your work. We are all complex human beings, am I right? Aside from all of the above, I invest some time in:

- Exercising at the gym, good for both your physical and mental health.
- Playing Tabletop RPGs, which lead to improvisation and using your imagination.
- Writing fiction stories, that allow me to play with creativity.
